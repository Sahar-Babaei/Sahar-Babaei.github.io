                                    My name is Sahar. I'm a senior design student at Simon Fraser University's School of Interactive Arts and Technology.                                    Thanks to the interdisciplinary nature of my academic program, I am well-versed in various aspects of design such as UI and UX design, UX research, Visual design, Art Direction, as well as mobile app, and web design and development. As a designer, I am driven by the challenge of understanding users, creatively addressing their needs and creating inclusive and enjoyable experiences for them. 
									Besides design, I also enjoy coding, visiting art exhibitions,and going on walks during golden hours.</a>
