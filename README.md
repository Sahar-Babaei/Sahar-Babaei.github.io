Things to do:
- add favicon
- add fonts
- add slight drop shadow to nav when in top bar
- fix spacing of elements in side bar
- add an extra breakpoint for top bar where your name appears as full
- i wonder if i have to add a container to main and then shift the main 13.8 to the side because of the side bar and then do auto margin for the container
- might wanna make the mobile top bar fixed position so people always have access to nav elements.
