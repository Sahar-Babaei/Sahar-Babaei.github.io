				<h2> Goodreads: UX research and UI redesign proposal </h2>
				<p> Launched in 2007, Goodreads is a free platform where book lovers can discover and discuss books, track reading activities, contribute reviews, and interact with the community. Throughout this academic project I conducted UX research and utilized UX methods such as user interviews, affinity mapping and userflows to identify points of frustration within the Goodreads iOS app. This was followed by a UI redesign proposal aimed at improving the organization of book-related information within the app and enhancing the app's book tracking function.   </p>

						<h4> 02 - Learning about users and their frustrations </h4>

						<h5> 
							Survey with 20 participants
						</h5>
						<p> To better understand the app’s users and learn about their most used features, the areas they find frustrating and the functionalities that matter most to them, i conducted a survey with 20 participants who were regular users of the goodreads app. </p>

						<h5> 
							Interview with 2 users
						</h5>
						<p> I conducted two user interviews with users from my social circle. Each interview took fifteen minutes. In each interview the user walked me through how they use the app to achieve their goals and explained their favorite and least favorite aspects of the app. </p>

						<h5> 
							App reviews & online forums
						</h5>
						<p> To gain more insight, I read and analyzed discussions about the app on online platforms where users discussed their frustrations with certain parts of the app. I also read and took note of all app reviews from the past year for both Android and iOS versions.

This is indicated by the small lock icon next to the list name.</p>

						<h4> 01 - Balance between UX research and UI design</h4>
						<p> Due to the limited timeline of this project, I needed to ensure to manage and distribute my time very carefully between the UX research and UI redesign stages of this project. This was difficult to manage because jumping too early into the redesign stage would lead to a design solution that is not backed up by proper UX research. On the other hand, spending too much time on UX research meant that i only had one week to come up with, design and prototype an effective UI redesgin.  </p>

						<h4> 02 - Match between the proposed redesign and the existing visual design of the app </h4>
						<p> Another challenge i faced while working on this project was ensuring that my proposed UI redesign fully matched the existing visual and interaction design patterns in the Goodreads app. As tempting as it was to change certain viusal elements and color palettes that looked outdated, i refrained from doing so because i knew any changes to the visual design and interaction design pattern of the app would drastically impact the branding of the app. I had to keep in mind that changing the app's visual language and brand identity did not fit into the scope of this project. </p>

							Shifting from group projects to working independently as a solo designer on this project was a unique experience. I found myself missing the fresh and unique presepectives that other designers bring into a project. At times I wished I had teammates to exchange ideas with and ask for feedback from. 
							
							This project reminded me of the importance of teamwork within the field of design while also helping me overcome my Imposter syndrom. Having to go through every step of this project on my own made me realize that I am a capable and well rounded designer. While I'll always appreciate working in team dynamics, I believe that working independently on this project was a valuable and necessary experience for me. Not only did it help me further develop my design skills, it also helped me trust in my own abilities as a designer.
