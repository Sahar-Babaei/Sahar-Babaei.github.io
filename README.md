Things to do:
- add favicon
- add fonts
- add slight drop shadow to nav when in top bar
- fix spacing of elements in side bar
- add an extra breakpoint for top bar where your name appears as full
- i wonder if i have to add a container to main and then shift the main 13.8 to the side because of the side bar and then do auto margin for the container
- might wanna make the mobile top bar fixed position so people always have access to nav elements. 
- OMG for decoration on main page i can make stickers like my green journal and randomly scatter them across the page and people can drag and drop them! and the stickers should have a drop shadow to make it look like they're on top of everything else. and what if clicking on stickers revealed random facts about me hehe

- change sizing of the square grid in bg based on breakpoint? 
- should i say i have a passion for creative design as opposed to ux design?


-omg i forgot to make a flaticon 

- for listerine's body. instead of grid do a flex container for copy and supermarket image and let the other images be full width. 

- kinda too late now but maybe i should use margin control for the bio page's flexbox
